## 📖 Overview

**KODR AI** is a comprehensive coding learning platform designed to bridge the gap between passive tutorial watching and active coding mastery. Unlike standard learning tools, KODR focuses on the "thinking process" by providing **line-by-line AI explanations**, adaptive learning paths, and real-time guidance. 

It addresses common challenges in modern education, such as the lack of real-time debugging guidance, fragmented progress tracking, and limited exposure to real-world projects. 

## ✨ Key Features

* **🤖 AI-Powered Line-by-Line Explanation:** Instantly simplifies complex logic and teaches you *how* to think, not just what to write. 


* **💻 Interactive Playground:** A real-time coding environment with instant AI guidance and feedback. 


* **📈 Adaptive Learning Engine:** Personalizes difficulty levels (Beginner to Advanced) based on your unique progress. 


* **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** Write and analyze code in languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. 


* **🏆 Gamified System:** Earn points, badges, and maintain streaks to boost consistency and engagement. 


* **📊 Smart Dashboard:** Track performance analytics, lines analyzed, and concepts mastered in one unified view. 


* **📂 Projects Hub:** Integration with real-world and open-source projects to build a portfolio-ready skillset. 


* **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Seamless login via Email, Google. 



## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Google Technologies

This solution leverages the power of Google's ecosystem to deliver low-latency, high-intelligence responses. 

* **AI Model:** **Gemini 2.5 Flash** – Provides real-time reasoning for fast, line-by-line code explanations. 


* **Inference Optimization:** **Nano Banana** – A lightweight AI inference layer for low-latency responses. 


* **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication** – Secure sign-in handling (Email, Google). 


* **Database:** **Firebase Firestore** – Real-time storage for user progress, learning data, and analytics. 


* **Analytics:** **Firebase Analytics** – Tracks user behavior and performance insights. 


* **Deployment:** **Firebase Hosting** – Scalable and reliable web hosting. 



## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

The platform follows a streamlined user flow to ensure maximum engagement and learning retention: 

1. **User Login:** Access via Web/App UI using Firebase Auth.
2. **Activity Selection:** Choose from the Coding Playground, Quizzes, or Projects.
3. **AI Analysis Layer:** User code is sent to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for analysis.
4. **Feedback Loop:** Users receive line-by-line explanations and debugging hints.
5. **Progress Storage:** Data and analytics are updated in **Firebase Firestore**.
6. **Adaptive Update:** The user's learning level adjusts based on performance.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

We have an ambitious roadmap to expand KODR into a full-scale developer ecosystem: 

* **VS Code Extension:** Bring line-by-line AI explanations directly into your IDE. 


* **Real-Time Guidance:** Debugging hints and logic explanation inside the editor. 


* **Expanded Languages:** Support for Rust, Go, and System Design basics. 


* **Interview Prep Mode:** DSA practice, mock interviews, and timed challenges. 


* **Collaboration:** Team features for hackathons and group projects. 


* **Offline Support:** Learning content with synced progress.
